# Commuting Signatures and Verifiable Encryption

Rust implementation of commuting signatures, a primitive introduced in the paper [Commuting Signatures and Verifiable Encryption and an Application to Non-Interactively Delegatable Credentials](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/233.pdf).

> a signer can encrypt both signature and message and prove validity; more importantly, given a ciphertext, a signer can create a verifiably encrypted signature on the encrypted message; thus signing and encrypting commute.
